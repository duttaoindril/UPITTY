				This application is designed to keep people awake at the wheel. Using facial recognition algorithms, the app will alert you when it detects that you are falling asleep while driving. The swipe feature keeps you awake because the device will beep at a time interval configured by the user, which will cue you to swipe over the camera. If the device does not detect anything, then the swipe interval decreases to 15 seconds at a decrement time of 3 seconds. Y=15-3x(Start at “x”, go to 15, 12, 9, etc). This will also set off the alarm. Also included is Carpool Scheduler. Carpool Scheduler is the solution to commute, money, and gasoline. By entering in your location, where you need to go, and when, the app will match you up with someone who lives near by, and needs to go to the same place and at the same time as you. By using this app, you can save twice the amount money, and the environment by cutting on your pollution, along with making your life a whole lot easier. Up.
